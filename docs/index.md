# Introduction

This Cards Against Humanity API is a simple project that we've decided to build to learn how to create RESTful API's and to use this on our small [Cards Against Humanity Discord bot](https://github.com/greencoast-studios/discord-cards-against-humanity).

## Source

The source of this API's data is a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeIMmSMT3nYv_YzucrToYouA4SMWTWr8G18lfCE61ZM) which was made and is currently maintained by a small number of contributors from the [Cards Against Humanity Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardsagainsthumanity/).

For more information, you can visit this [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardsagainsthumanity/comments/5hwhbj/the_card_listing_spreadsheet_new_editor_new/).

## Usage

Please refer to the [API reference](api_reference.md) to see a detailed guide on requesting this API.

## Small Notice

This API is still not finished, we're planning on adding more card packs and more features to improve this service.

This API was built with education purposes, you're more than welcome to clone our [project repo](https://github.com/greencoast-studios/discord-cards-against-humanity) and do any changes you want, it is up to you what you do with this.
